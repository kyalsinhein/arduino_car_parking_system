# arduino_car_parking_system

Designed and implemented a smart door system using Arduino Uno with motion detection feature.

## Research Purpose
To reduce carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles by eliminating unnecessary driving within parking areas through automated slot allocation and real-time availability tracking.

## System Components & Features
- Automated Gate Control: Opens/closes gate based on parking availability
- Dual Sensor System: Entry and exit sensors for accurate slot counting
- Real-time Slot Tracking: Digital display shows available parking spaces
- Smart Access Control: Gate only opens when slots are available
- Servo Motor Integration: Smooth gate operation mechanism
- Central Arduino Control: All devices connected to Arduino Uno board
